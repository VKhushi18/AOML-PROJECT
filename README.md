PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Technical hiring is time-consuming and often subjective, with recruiters and hiring managers spending significant time reviewing resumes and conducting preliminary interviews. This project addresses these challenges by:
â€¢Automating Resume Screening: Analyzing candidate resumes to identify relevant skills and experience for specific job roles.
â€¢Conducting Standardized Interviews: Providing a consistent interview experience with both technical and behavioral questions tailored to different job roles.
â€¢Generating Objective Evaluations: Using multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, KNN, and XGBoost) to evaluate candidates based on their resume and interview performance.
â€¢Providing Data-Driven Recommendations: Generating hiring recommendations with confidence scores and specific feedback on candidate strengths and areas for improvement.
